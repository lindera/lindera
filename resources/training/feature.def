# Feature template definitions for training
# These define how features are extracted from the morphological data

# Unigram features (word-level features)
UNIGRAM U00:%F[0]    # Part of speech
UNIGRAM U01:%F[0],%F?[1]    # POS + sub-category
UNIGRAM U02:%F[0],%F[1],%F?[2]    # POS hierarchy

# Bigram features (transition features between words)
# Format: BIGRAM label:%L[index]/%R[index]
# %L = left context (previous word), %R = right context (next word)
BIGRAM B00:%L[0]/%R[0]    # POS-to-POS transition
BIGRAM B01:%L[0],%L?[1]/%R[0]    # Left POS hierarchy to right POS
BIGRAM B02:%L[0]/%R[0],%R?[1]    # Left POS to right POS hierarchy
BIGRAM B03:%L[0],%L[1],%L?[2]/%R[0]    # Detailed left to simple right
