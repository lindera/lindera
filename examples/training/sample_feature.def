# Feature template definitions for training
# These define how features are extracted from the morphological data

# Unigram features (word-level features)
UNIGRAM:%F[0]    # Part of speech (first element of features)
UNIGRAM:%F[1]    # Sub-category 1
UNIGRAM:%F[6]    # Base form
UNIGRAM:%F[7]    # Reading (katakana)

# Left context features (for transition costs)
LEFT:%L[0]       # Left word POS
LEFT:%L[1]       # Left word sub-category

# Right context features (for transition costs)
RIGHT:%R[0]      # Right word POS
RIGHT:%R[1]      # Right word sub-category

# Bigram features (combinations)
UNIGRAM:%F[0]/%F[1]    # POS + sub-category
UNIGRAM:%F[0]/%F[6]    # POS + base form
