/// This module defines character filters and utilities for handling text transformations
/// in the Lindera library. It includes various character filters such as Japanese iteration
/// mark filter, mapping filter, regex filter, and unicode normalization filter. The module
/// also provides functionality to load character filters from configuration values or CLI flags,
/// and utilities to manage text offsets during transformations.
///
/// # Offset Mapping System
///
/// The offset mapping system tracks how character positions change during text filtering,
/// allowing accurate mapping between filtered text positions and original text positions.
/// This is essential for maintaining correct token byte offsets in tokenization.
///
/// ## How Offset Mapping Works
///
/// When text is transformed by character filters, each transformation is recorded as a
/// `Transformation` that captures:
/// - Original text byte range (before filtering)  
/// - Filtered text byte range (after filtering)
///
/// ### Example: "１０㍑" → "10リットル"
///
/// ```text
/// Original:  "１０㍑"
/// Positions:  0-3  3-6  6-9     (byte positions)
///              ↓    ↓    ↓
/// Filtered:  "10リットル"  
/// Positions:  0-1  1-2  2-14    (byte positions)
/// ```
///
/// This creates three transformations:
/// 1. "１" (0-3) → "1" (0-1)
/// 2. "０" (3-6) → "0" (1-2)
/// 3. "㍑" (6-9) → "リットル" (2-14)
///
/// ### Position Correction
///
/// To map a filtered text position back to the original:
/// 1. Find which transformation range contains the position
/// 2. Calculate the corresponding position in the original text
/// 3. Return the original text position
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use lindera::character_filter::{OffsetMapping, Transformation};
/// # let mut mapping = OffsetMapping::new();
/// # mapping.add_transformation(Transformation::new(6, 9, 2, 14));
/// # let text = "10リットル";
/// // For filtered position 2 ("リットル" start):
/// // → finds transformation[2]: filtered_range(2-14) contains position 2
/// // → returns original_start: 6 (start of "㍑")
/// let original_pos = mapping.correct_offset(2, text.len()); // returns 6
/// ```
///
/// This ensures that tokenizer can provide accurate byte offsets relative to the original
/// input text, even after multiple character transformations.
///
/// # Modules
/// - `japanese_iteration_mark`: Contains the Japanese iteration mark character filter.
/// - `mapping`: Contains the mapping character filter.
/// - `regex`: Contains the regex character filter.
/// - `unicode_normalize`: Contains the unicode normalization character filter.
///
/// # Traits
/// - `CharacterFilter`: A trait for character filters that can be applied to text.
/// - `CharacterFilterClone`: A trait for cloning character filters.

/// - `CharacterFilterLoader`: A loader for character filters from configuration values or CLI flags.

/// - `Transformation`: A record of text transformation with original and filtered positions.

/// # use lindera::character_filter::{OffsetMapping, Transformation};

/// // When "㍑" → "リットル" transformation occurs:
/// mapping.add_transformation(Transformation::new(6, 9, 2, 14));
/// ```
///
/// 2. **Correct positions** from filtered to original:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use lindera::character_filter::OffsetMapping;
/// # let mapping = OffsetMapping::new();
/// # let filtered_pos = 0;
/// # let text = String::new();
/// let original_pos = mapping.correct_offset(filtered_pos, text.len());
/// ```
///
/// # Multi-Filter Support
///
/// When multiple character filters are applied, their mappings are composed:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use lindera::character_filter::OffsetMapping;
/// # let mapping1 = OffsetMapping::new();
/// # let mapping2 = OffsetMapping::new();
/// let combined_mapping = mapping1.compose(mapping2);
/// ```
///
/// This ensures accurate position tracking through complex filter chains.

///
/// - `name(&self) -> &str`:

///
/// # Trait Bounds
///
/// - `'static`: The filter must have a `'static` lifetime, meaning it does not contain any references with shorter lifetimes.
/// - `Send` and `Sync`: These bounds ensure that the filter can be safely used in multi-threaded contexts, allowing filters to be shared or sent across threads.
