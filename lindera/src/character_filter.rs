/// The `CharacterFilter` trait defines an interface for filters that preprocess text before tokenization.
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// - `name(&self) -> &str`:
///   - Returns the name of the character filter. This can be used for identification or logging purposes.
///
/// - `apply(&self, text: &mut String) -> LinderaResult<(Vec<usize>, Vec<i64>, usize)>`:
///   - Applies the character filter to the provided mutable string `text`.
///   - It returns a result containing a tuple of:
///     - A vector of offsets (`Vec<usize>`) which represent positions in the text where modifications were made.
///     - A vector of differences (`Vec<i64>`) which indicates the change in text length at those positions.
///     - The final length of the modified text (`usize`).
///
/// # Trait Bounds
///
/// - `'static`: The filter must have a `'static` lifetime, meaning it does not contain any references with shorter lifetimes.
/// - `Send` and `Sync`: These bounds ensure that the filter can be safely used in multi-threaded contexts, allowing filters to be shared or sent across threads.
///
/// # Cloneability
///
/// - This trait requires the `CharacterFilterClone` trait, which is typically used to allow cloning of trait objects that implement `CharacterFilter`. This enables dynamic dispatch of cloned filters.
pub trait CharacterFilter: 'static + Send + Sync + CharacterFilterClone {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;

}

/// A struct that holds a boxed `CharacterFilter` trait object.
///
/// `BoxCharacterFilter` wraps a `Box<dyn CharacterFilter + 'static + Send + Sync>`, allowing for dynamic dispatch of character filters while ensuring they are thread-safe and have a `'static` lifetime.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `0: Box<dyn CharacterFilter + 'static + Send + Sync>`:
///   - The boxed character filter trait object, which can be any type that implements the `CharacterFilter` trait. This allows for runtime polymorphism, meaning different character filter implementations can be stored in the same collection or passed around generically.
///
/// # Trait Bounds
///
/// - `CharacterFilter`: The wrapped object must implement the `CharacterFilter` trait, which defines the interface for applying filters to text.
/// - `'static`: The wrapped object must have a `'static` lifetime, meaning it can live for the duration of the program and does not borrow from temporary data.
/// - `Send` and `Sync`: These bounds ensure the filter can be shared between threads and sent across thread boundaries, making it safe for concurrent use.
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// `BoxCharacterFilter` allows you to store and use different types of character filters dynamically, making it easier to apply multiple filters without needing to know their concrete types at compile time.
